## Untitled Reality

This is [Alberto](https://github.com/albertoxamin)'s and [mine](https://github.com/danibix95) project we developed at the Vertical Innovation Hacktathon 2018 in Bozen. We focused on a tasks based on the Lichtbild Argento vivo open dataset, eploring what opportunities can provide Augumented Reality and Virtual Reality applied to those open data.

## AR Instagram & Facebook Filters

## Virtual Tour
In order to run the Virtual Tour locally, it is necessary to start a simple web server that serve the project page, `index.html`.
Accordingly, it is possible to exploit `python` to achieve this goal. Indeed, open a terminal in the `VR` folder and run the follwing command:

    python3 -m http.server

Then, oper your browser and visit the following link: (http://localhost:8000/src/index.html)

If you feel tired or you don't know where to start, you can enjoy a running demo at this [link](https://danibix95.github.io/HackBZ/VR/src/index.html).
